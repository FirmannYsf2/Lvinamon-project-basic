      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        LVinnamon was founded in 2020 with a vision to bring the rich flavors of cinnamon to the world. It all started with a small hobby of a student in Jakarta town, where our founder, Mikael, experimented with various cinnamon recipes to create delightful treats for the local community.
      </p>
      <p>
        As word spread about the exceptional taste and quality of our cinnamon products, the demand grew rapidly. With passion and dedication, the founder expanded the operations and established LVinnamon as a leading cinnamon brand in Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, LVinnamon is known for its superior quality cinnamon products that are loved by people of all ages. We continue to uphold our commitment to delivering the finest cinnamon experience and expanding our reach worldwide.
